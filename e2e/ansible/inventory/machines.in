# This is a input file used by OpenEBS for generating the hosts.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names and login 
# details for that host. Each entry should be kept on an individual line. 
# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the 
# corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# comma.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or before the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#master,20.10.26.11,MACHINES_USER_NAME,MACHINES_USER_PASSWORD
#host,20.10.26.12,USER_NAME,USER_PASSWORD
#host,20.10.26.14,USER_NAME,USER_PASSWORD


master,20.10.49.11,MACHINES_USER_NAME,MACHINES_USER_PASSWORD
host,20.10.49.12,USER_NAME,USER_PASSWORD
host,20.10.49.13,USER_NAME,USER_PASSWORD
