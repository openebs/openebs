OpenShift Examples
================

You can install example db-templates by copying examples from this module to your 
first master and importing them with oc create -n into the openshift namespace or
using "Import YAML / JSON" button from the web console.

Templates may require specific versions of OpenShift so they've been namespaced. 
At this time, once a new version of Origin is released
the older versions will only receive new content by speficic request.

Please file an issue at https://github.com/openebs/openebs you'd
like to see older content updated and have tested to ensure it's backwards
compatible.
