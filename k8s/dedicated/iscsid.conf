# Timeouts
# ********

# See the iSCSI REAME's Advanced Configuration section for tips
# on setting timeouts when using multipath or doing root over iSCSI.
#
# To specify the length of time to wait for session re-establishment
# before failing SCSI commands back to the application when running
# the Linux SCSI Layer error handler, edit the line.
# The value is in seconds and the default is 120 seconds.
# Special values:
# - If the value is 0, IO will be failed immediately.
# - If the value is less than 0, IO will remain queued until the session
# is logged back in, or until the user runs the logout command.

# The value is in seconds and the default is 15 seconds.
node.conn[0].timeo.logout_timeout = 15

# Time interval to wait for on connection before sending a ping.
node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = 300

# To specify the time to wait for a Nop-out response before failing
# the connection, edit this line. Failing the connection will
# cause IO to be failed back to the SCSI layer. If using dm-multipath
# this will cause the IO to be failed to the multipath layer.
node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = 300

# To specify the time to wait for abort response before
# failing the operation and trying a logical unit reset edit the line.
# The value is in seconds and the default is 15 seconds.
node.session.err_timeo.abort_timeout = 300

# To specify the time to wait for a logical unit response
# before failing the operation and trying session re-establishment

#******
# Retry
#******

# To specify the number of times iscsid should retry a login
# if the login attempt fails due to the node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout
# expiring modify the following line. Note that if the login fails
# quickly (before node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout fires) because the network
# layer or the target returns an error, iscsid may retry the login more than
# node.session.initial_login_retry_max times.
#
# This retry count along with node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout
# determines the maximum amount of time iscsid will try to
# establish the initial login. node.session.initial_login_retry_max is
# multiplied by the node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout to determine the
# maximum amount.
#
# The default node.session.initial_login_retry_max is 8 and
# node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout is 15 so we have:
#
# node.conn[0].timeo.login_timeout * node.session.initial_login_retry_max =
#								120 seconds
#
# Valid values are any integer value. This only
# affects the initial login. Setting it to a high value can slow
# down the iscsi service startup. Setting it to a low value can
# cause a session to not get logged into, if there are distuptions
# during startup or if the network is not ready at that time.
node.session.initial_login_retry_max = 8

# session and device queue depth

# MISC SYSTEM PERFORMANCE SETTINGS
##################################

# For software iscsi (iscsi_tcp) and iser (ib_iser) each session
# has a thread used to transmit or queue data to the hardware. For
# cxgb3i you will get a thread per host.
#
# Setting the thread's priority to a lower value can lead to higher throughput
# and lower latencies. The lowest value is -20. Setting the priority to
# a higher value, can lead to reduced IO performance, but if you are seeing
# the iscsi or scsi threads dominate the use of the CPU then you may want
# to set this value higher.
#
# Note: For cxgb3i you must set all sessions to the same value, or the
# behavior is not defined.

# The default value is -20. The setting must be between -20 and 20.
